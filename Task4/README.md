This is a bare bone plan that I will follow to complete this Task:

- Define essential and complementary functionalites influenced by the components, PCB and the enclosure
- Write the Bill of Materials following best practices
- Design the schematic 
- Routing
- Verification and testing(simulated)
- Print the PCBs (PCBway or other platforms (price and component availablity will matter the most))
- Testing the physical PCB
- Designing the enclosures
- Printing the enclosures
- Assembly of components and eclosures 
- Pray it works
