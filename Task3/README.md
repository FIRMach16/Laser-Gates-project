# Laser Gate Android App

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an Android application that stores and displays metrics sent by the laser gates.

As this is a learning project, I chose to structure my approach using the **Agile methodology**. This not only aligns with modern development practices but also increases the chances of finishing the app within a reasonable timeframe.

## 1. Backlog

### Solo Sprinter
- As a solo sprinter, I want to connect to the laser gates (ESP32) and receive live data.  
- As a solo sprinter, I want to check my history of progression.  
- As a solo sprinter, I want to input the distance between start and end gates for fly sprints.  
- As a solo sprinter, I want to switch easily between history and live data screens.  

### Coach
- As a coach, I want all the same functionalities as a solo sprinter.  
- As a coach, I want to smoothly check each of my athletesâ€™ stats.  

### Developer
- As the developer, I want to make the app optionally connectable to a cloud computing environment.  
  (This is not a core objective for this project, but it supports learning goals and future integration with other sensor systems.)  


## 2. Priorities
- **Core Objectives**: ESP32 connectivity, live data view, history tracking, basic navigation.  
- **Nice-to-have**: Coach view with multiple athletes.  
- **Stretch goal**: Cloud integration.  


## 3. Sprint Plan
- **Sprint 1**: Implement ESP32 and Android connection and display live metrics.  
- **Sprint 2**: Add UI for history tracking and progression.  
- **Sprint 3**: Add navigation between screens and input for distance.  
- **Sprint 4**: Explore coach mode and optional cloud integration.  

## 4. Progression

- **Sprint1** Managed to get data from the esp32 server still not updating UI (delayed by 2 days on the expected timeframe mainly due to learning process).

Problems to fix : 
1. App don't connect automatically to the ESP32 network (Right now I need to connect manually).
2. The communication happen in plaintext (potential security issues?) [config](./AndroidApp/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml).
3. Multipe @Serialisable data classes may not be the correct way to go for data acquisition.

- **Sprint2** (In Progress):

This will include managing a database to save data and another activity that will be connected to two fragments, the activity will show the latest performance of the sprinter and also his PB (Personal Best) in avreage speed and instatnous speed, one fragment will have a recycler view to show the all the data in a table forma, the other fragment will show in graph form the evolution of the times of the sprinter and will include a filter feature.
