⚡ LaserGates: A Low-Cost, Accurate Timing System for Sprinters

This project aims to develop a custom-built, affordable, and precise sprint timing system from scratch — designed specifically for track athletes and sprint coaches. The goal is to create a reliable alternative to expensive commercial timing gates, using readily available hardware and custom software.

The system is still in active development. I’ve made this repository public to document my progress, encourage feedback, and share insights along the way.
