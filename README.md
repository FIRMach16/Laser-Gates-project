⚡ LaserGates: A Low-Cost, Accurate Timing System for Sprinters

This project aims to develop a custom-built, affordable, and precise sprint timing system from scratch — designed specifically for track athletes and sprint coaches. The goal is to create a reliable alternative to expensive commercial timing gates, using readily available hardware and custom software.

The system is still in active development. I’ve made this repository public to document my progress, encourage feedback, and share insights along the way. 
## Tasks:
These tasks are milestones in the project that demonstrate my learning process: 
- [TaskOne](TaskOne/) : Creating a websocket and publishing the timestamp on a button click
- [TaskTwo](TaskTwo/) : A two gates system (uses button for now) that communicates VIA ESP-NOW and publish the metrics (Time diffrence ,2 Instant Speeds) with websocket, #TODO :**Measure the 2 way latencey of the ESP protocol to verify time keeping accuracy**
